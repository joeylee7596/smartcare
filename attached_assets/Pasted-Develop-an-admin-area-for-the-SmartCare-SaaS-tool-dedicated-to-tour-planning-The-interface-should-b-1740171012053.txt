Develop an admin area for the SmartCare SaaS tool dedicated to tour planning. The interface should be a single-page layout divided into three main sections. On the left, include a sidebar with a search field for patient names, filter options (such as urgency, location, and care type), and a date picker to select the desired day; below these controls, display a list of scheduled patient visits with key information such as patient name, address, scheduled time, and care requirement, along with simple buttons to mark a visit as completed or to add notes. In the center, implement an interactive map view integrated with a mapping API (e.g., Google Maps or OpenStreetMap) that displays all planned stops as color-coded routes based on priority and caregiver assignment; enable drag-and-drop functionality so the admin can manually adjust the order of stops, with the system automatically recalculating travel times using real-time traffic data and AI-based optimization. On the right, design a vertical timeline that visualizes the day’s schedule for each caregiver in separate columns or blocks, where each time slot displays the patient name, address, estimated duration, and current status; allow the admin to click on a time block to open detailed visit information or to reschedule a visit via drag-and-drop, and ensure that any changes update the map and patient list in real time. Include a clearly labeled “Save Plan” button at the bottom of the page to commit all changes and automatically generate a summary report of the day’s planned tour. The overall design must be clean, minimalistic, and fully responsive, featuring a clear font, ample white space, and distinct, easy-to-understand buttons, so that an admin with limited technical skills can plan and modify tours with no more than two clicks per action. Additionally, integrate AI functions for real-time route optimization, conflict detection, and scheduling suggestions, ensuring the system offers alternative slots when delays or overlaps occur.
